There’s a quiet honesty in the late nights when most of the world is asleep and I’m untangling Savify’s code, one bug and one API error at a time.

Most nights lately revolve around making Savify better for our growing base of over 500 users. Some evenings, it’s figuring out why our Plaid integration hiccups when someone’s bank decides to change something at 3 a.m. Other times, it’s sketching out new partnership ideas and adding features that might actually help people save, which is harder than it sounds when the product touches real money.

Working alongside my team of five, I’ve learned that building trust in personal finance is more about countless small fixes than grand plans. You can’t fake reliability, you earn it transaction by transaction, update by update. Between collaborating with banks, pushing patches at odd hours, and keeping an eye on logs that never sleep, I’ve come to accept that FinTech doesn’t follow a neat roadmap.

When the code finally behaves and the console stays quiet, I’ll pour myself a modest glass of cognac if there’s any left. It’s never an 18-year-old bottle, that’s out of my student budget for now. Maybe I’ll splurge on something better if I land an internship soon, and something truly special if Savify secures the funding we’re working toward.

Until then, the routine stays the same: build, fix, save, sip and repeat.

Cheers.
